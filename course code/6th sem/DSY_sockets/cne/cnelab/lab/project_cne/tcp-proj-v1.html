<h2 align="center">TCP PEP (Performance Enhancing Proxy) Correctness
Project<br>
</h2>
<br>
There is plenty of evidence (and commercial products) showing that TCP
PEPs improve E2E performance.&nbsp; Some forms of PEP (Performance
Enhancing Proxy), however, do so
only by breaking the E2E TCP semantics.&nbsp; Specifically, the PEP may
acknowledge packets that it has received, but that have not yet been
acknowledged by the true end host.&nbsp; As a result, PEPs are
considered a bad idea by both the research and standards communities in
spite of their performance advantages.<br>
<br>
I suspect that PEPs have to an extent unfairly gotten a bad rap.&nbsp;
The reason is that TCP correctness is typically decoupled from
application correctness---indeed, the application cannot even tell,
through the socket interface, which bytes have been acknowledged by the
other end and which have not.&nbsp; If the application provides its own
acknowledgment, then a bogus acknowledgment from TCP will not
compromise the correctness of the application (i.e. the sender won't be
mistaken about what the receiver has gotten).<br>
<br>
I would like to better understand what exactly the consequences of
breaking TCP reliability semantics are from the application's point of
view.&nbsp; To do this, I'd like each student to examine one
application carefully (including looking at its software) and determine
analytically if its correctness would be broken by a broken TCP.&nbsp;
In doing this, the student should assume that the PEP has the following
properties:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; The PEP can detect when E2E byte acknowledgment semantics have
been broken (i.e. it acknowledges to the sender a byte that the
receiver will never receive), and it resets the connection when this
happens.<br>
2a.&nbsp; The PEP never makes transmission errors.<br>
2b.&nbsp; The PEP may make a transmission error (i.e. by itself
corrupting bytes while it buffers the stream, but providing the
receiver a checksum that computes correctly on the corrupted bytes).<br>
<br>
Please mail to the class mailing list (cs619-l) which application you
would like to analyze, and which public domain software package you
will use.&nbsp; Only pick an application that has not yet been claimed
by another student.<br>
<br>
The deliverable for this project will be a short description of whether
the application will break (where breaking here means that the sending
application thinks that the receiver has received something that it
hasn't), if so how, and if not, why not.<br>
