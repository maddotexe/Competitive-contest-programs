<h3>Objective</h3>



<a href="http://www.planet-lab.org/">PlanetLab</a> is a global
networking testbed founded to give academic researchers a way to
evaluate and deploy true Internet-scale services and applications.
&nbsp;It currently supports over 900 individual machines spread across
over 470 locations on 5 continents. &nbsp;The objective of this
homework is to experiment with PlanetLab and gather first-hand
measurements of the Internet from a global perspective, as it is today.
&nbsp;Specifically, we are looking to evaluate (at a very rough
granularity) the types of unexpected and abnormal behavior first
observed in [Pax96].

<h3>Assignment</h3>

In this assignment, you will implement a simple measurement platform
where 20 Internet PL nodes of your choice periodically perform
pair-wise path measurements using ping and traceroute. &nbsp; Your
service should run as daemons on the subset of PlanetLab hosts you
choose, gathering data over a period of at least 2 weeks. Your
measurement nodes should maintain and store logs on the local disk, and
move them periodically to your CSIL account. &nbsp;Once all of
your measurements have completed, you should analyze the measurement
data to answer the questions below. Note that you want to save some
time at the end in case you want to go back and perform additional
measurements to support your answers.<br>
<br>
Please read all of the questions below before writing your measurement
daemons, since you will likely need to tailor your daemon based on the
answers you need.&nbsp; Also, beware the flakiness of Planetlab nodes,
which means that you will want to pull data files off of them
frequently, lest the machine fails and takes your experimental logs
with them.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Questions</span><br>

<ol>

  <li>How often did you detect outages in pair-wise paths between your nodes (as a portion of all paths monitored)? &nbsp;</li>
  
  <ol>
    <li>How many of them were temporary? &nbsp;For each temporary
failure, can you determine the likely cause from your measurements?
&nbsp;If so, what is it? If not, what missing data would allow you to
determine the real cause?</li>
    <li>How many failures were long term outages? Remember that PL
machines go down often for maintenance and repair. &nbsp;You should
read the PL-user mailing list to hear announcements of planned
downtime. &nbsp;Can you determine the root cause for each of your
long-term outages? What are they?<br>


    </li>


  
  
  </ol>


  <li>Of
the outages in pair-wise paths you detected, what percentage of them
are failures in the "core" versus local ISP failures?&nbsp; <br>
</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Of these failures, how many could be successfully circumvented
in "real time" by an SOSR-like system?&nbsp; (Hint: this might require
you to instrument your measurement daemons with additional code for
triggering tests at a random third PL node).</li>
    <li>Did you detect a significant difference in the reliability of 
continental links versus inter-continental links that crossed the 
Pacific or Atlantic oceans?<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Did you detect route "fluttering", if so, where and how often?&nbsp;<br>


  </li>



  <li>Did you detect "abnormal" triangle routing, where the traceroute
path traversed a network hop out of the "expected" general direction of
the destination? &nbsp;Describe these routes, if any.<br>


  </li>


  <li>Plot your average pair-wise latency distributions in a CDF. Based on your measurements, can
you detect which nodes in your network are Internet2 hosts?
&nbsp;(Hint: some Internet2 hosts are reachable only by other Internet2
hosts, and not by Internet1 hosts.)<br>


  </li>


  <li>Based on your small sample of measurement data, do you think
routing abnormalities have increased or decreased in number from the
days when Paxson first performed these measurements? &nbsp;Why?<br>


  </li>


</ol>


<big style="font-weight: bold;">Choosing PlanetLab nodes</big><br>


Beware that a number of PlanetLab hosts are "Alpha" machines. &nbsp;I
suggest logging into each of your desired nodes first to see if they
are designated Alpha nodes. Alpha nodes will report their status to you
every time you log in. &nbsp;In general, you want to choose nodes that
are spread out in geographic location. You can log on to planet-lab.org 
and choose your own nodes by going to the right and going to the slice 
management section. &nbsp;I suggest choosing nodes such that you include the
following subsets:<br>


<ul>


  <li>at least 2-3 nodes from continents other than N. America</li>


  <li>at least 1 transatlantic and 1 transpacific link</li>


  <li>at least 1 group of 2-3 hosts from the same site, so you can include LAN results in your measurements</li>


</ul>


<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choosing measurement periodicity</span></big><br>


Remember that some node-pairs can be very far apart (a la Estonia to
New Zealand). You should measure at a frequency that allows each prior
traceroute to finish before the new traceroute starts. &nbsp;1
measurement every 10 minutes is probably safe.<br>


<br>


<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Workload</span></big><br>Hi
all. I will assign students in the class randomly into slices, with
roughly 2 students per slice. It is fine if you collaborate with the
other student you are sharing a slice with, but only with
him/her.&nbsp; In the table below,
I have listed the slice names and users in each
slice. I will continue to update this table as more users sign up for
accounts.&nbsp; Some of the slices have not had their nodes assigned
yet.
You can do it yourself by going to your slice and then choosing manage
nodes.<br>
