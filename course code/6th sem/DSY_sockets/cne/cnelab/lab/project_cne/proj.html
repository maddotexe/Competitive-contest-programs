Assigned: Friday, November 13, 1998
Due: Tuesday, December 8, 1998
<p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00001000000000000000">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This assignment is to design and implement a reliable protocol on top of an
unreliable delivery mechanism.  You are to do this project in a Unix
environment using the TCP/IP protocol to exchange messages.
</p><p>
The project is intended to expose you to at least four aspects of computer
networks--the client/server paradigm, working with a real network protocol
(TCP/IP), the concept of layering and issues in the design of a reliable
protocol.  You have already done some work with the first two items, which
you will be building on for this assignment.  The following description
outlines the project.  It defines many of the details, but leaves other
decisions on functionality and design up to you.
</p><p>
You are to create a client and server process that communicate at the
lowest layer via a TCP connection.  On top of this connection you will be
sending messages.  While the TCP connection will reliably deliver all
messages you will introduce errors in message delivery so that some
proportion of messages are simply dropped and not sent at all.  This
unreliability will require you to create a reliable delivery mechanism on
top of the ``unreliable'' channel.
</p><p>
You will be implementing two layers--an application layer and a data link
layer.  The application layer will communicate (via procedure calls)
directly with the data link layer for sending and receiving messages.  The
most straightforward project design will include the application and data
layers as part of the same Unix process.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00002000000000000000">Application Layer</a></h2>
<p>
You will be creating a file transfer application that will allow the client
to send a file to the server for storage.  The file being transferred can
be of arbitrary size and type (it is not restricted to be a text file).
The client should initially send the name that the remote server should use
to store the file.
</p><p>
You should define message types for all communication between your client
and server (similar to defining message types defined for communication
with the oracle server).  However, the data portion of your messages is
limited to 100 bytes in size.  You will need to define a means to
accommodate file transfers requiring more than a single message.
</p><p>
The application layer interfaces with the data link layer via the following
routines: <em>DataLinkInit()</em>, <em>DataLinkSend()</em>, <em>DataLinkRecv()</em>
and <em>DataLinkCleanup()</em>.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00003000000000000000">Data Link Layer</a></h2>
<p>
The data link layer accepts data passed via <em>DataLinkSend()</em>, places
the data into a data link frame, and sends the frame on the TCP/IP link for
transmission.  The design of your data link layer must include the ability
to handle an error-prone channel.  Thus, the data link layer must include
considerations for buffering, retransmissions and some form of flow
control.
</p><p>
You must implement some type of sliding window protocol (see Tanenbaum for
details).  At a minimum you must use a single-bit sliding window protocol,
but you are encouraged to use a send window size greater than three.  In
the latter case your data link layer will have to handle buffering at the
sender and/or receiver.  If an application attempts to transmit messages
beyond the window size, the data link layer will block until space becomes
available.
</p><p>
Retransmissions will require a timer mechanism to detect lack of
acknowledgments.  These can be done using the <em>select()</em> system call
introduced in the last assignment.  See the man page for how to use the
timer facility of <em>select()</em>.
</p><p>
For the basic project, your server will continually call <em>
DataLinkRecv()</em> to receive messages from the client.  Initially it will
receive the name of the file to create, followed by the contents of the
file (in one or more messages).  When the entire file has been transferred,
the server should close the file for writing.  If multiple messages can be
outstanding at a time, messages received by the data link layer on the
server may not be immediately passed up to the application layer because
they are not the next one expected.  Depending on the data link layer
protocol you are implementing, these out-of-sequence messages will either
be buffered or discarded.  When the server receives a message it should
generate an ACK or a NAK as appropriate to your protocol.
</p><p>
The actual communication with the server takes place using Unix sockets and
TCP/IP.  You will need to initialize these structures at the beginning of
your client and server code in a routine written by you called <em>
DataLinkInit()</em>.  Use your Unix uid as the port number for your server
unless this value conflicts with another server in which case pick a
random value.  You will NOT be using oracle for this assignment.  Your data
link layer routines <em>DataLinkSend()</em> and <em>DataLinkRecv()</em> will
use the TCP connection for all data transmission.  The link corresponds to
the physical layer of a real network.  When the client or server has
completed its use of the channel, it should call <em>DataLinkCleanup()</em> to
terminate the connection.  Note that if the data link layer on the client
is buffering then sent, but unacknowledged, messages that it will need to wait
until all messages have been acknowledged before terminating the
connection.
</p><p>
As part of introducing unreliability into the network transmission you
are responsible for artificially dropping frames in the transmission.
Dropping a frame simply means not transmitting it for this assignment.  Any
frame that is sent (setup, data, ACK, NAK, etc) can be potentially lost.
The error rate to be used by the client and the server should be given on
the command line when each is started up as indicated below.  Obviously
your data link layer should not ``know'' whether a frame will be lost and
will have to discover that problem via the protocol you implement.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00004000000000000000">Interface</a></h2>
<p>
The command line interface for your client and server is as follows:
</p><p>
</p><pre>&gt; server errorpct

&gt; client errorpct put inputfile [outputfile]</pre>
<p>
where <tt>errorpct</tt> is an integer between 0 and 100.  It represents the
percent of frames that should be dropped by that process.  An error
percentage of zero means that all frames are correctly transmitted.  An
error percentage of 50 means that 50% of the frames are dropped and not
sent.  You should initially work with an error rate of zero and experiment
with other values once you have your client and server working.
</p><p>
The <tt>put</tt> argument simply indicates the client is sending the file.
It can be changed to <tt>get</tt> if you do more advanced work on the project.
The <tt>inputfile</tt> is the file to read and send to the server.  The
optional argument <tt>outputfile</tt> is the name that the server should use
in creating the file.  If no <tt>outputfile</tt> argument is given then the
server should use the same name as the client.  Beware of this option if
the client and server are running from the same directory.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00005000000000000000">Output</a></h2>
<p>
In order to observe the performance of the sliding window protocol and to
check whether your implementation is working properly, you need to collect
statistics.  You should collect statistics for both the client and server.
After transferring a file you should print out the following suggested
statistics (you should add your own which are appropriate to your specific
project):
</p><p>
</p><ol><p></p><li> the total number of data frames transmitted<p></p></li><li> the total number of retransmissions<p></p></li><li> the total number of acknowledgments sent<p></p></li><li> the total number of acknowledgments received<p></p></li><li> the total number of duplicate frames received<p></p></li><li> the total amount of data sent
</li></ol>
<p>
For your debugging purposes you may wish to show the size of frames
sent and received.  For performance analysis purposes you should
consider measuring the time required to satisfy a client request.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00006000000000000000">Design Decisions</a></h2>
<p>
Students are encouraged to work in two-person groups of your choosing, but
individual projects are acceptable.  You should select a partner who has
similar goals for the project as yourself.  Projects will be graded equally
for all team members unless exceptional circumstances arise.
</p><p>
One issue to address in your design for the project is what protocol to use
for handling errors.  More credit will be given to projects that correctly
implement a protocol that allows multiple outstanding messages (such as
``go back n'' or ``selective repeat'') as opposed to projects that
implement a simple ``stop and wait'' protocol.  However projects that do
not work will be penalized regardless of the protocol.  Hence it is better
to turn in a project that works with a simpler data link protocol than one
that does not work with a more complex protocol.
</p><p>
An enhancement that you may implement for additional credit is to allow
not only of sending of a file from the client to the server, but also allow
retrieving a file from the server to the client.  The command line interface
is the same as given previously except the <tt>put</tt> command should be
changed to <tt>get</tt>.
</p><p>
Another enhancement for additional credit is to send and receive frames
byte-by-byte using character delimiters for frames along with character
stuffing and checksums.  If this enhancement is used then your error rates
will be on a per-byte rather than per-frame basis.  In this case you should
use a larger integer range for error rates.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00007000000000000000">Project Deadlines</a></h2>
<p>
The project has two deadlines:
</p><p>
</p><ol><p></p><li> Design Report                  (Due: Tuesday, November 24, 1998)
<p>
Each group will turn in a typed design report (one or two pages) defining
the project and explaining the work to be done.  The design should include
the team members, the data link layer protocol to be used along with
message structures and types.  You should also indicate what statistics you
intend to gather.  This design should clearly explain the final product and
include a schedule of work to be done.  These designs will be reviewed and
returned with comments, but not actually graded.</p><p></p></li><li> Final Project and Report              (Due: Tuesday, December 8, 1998)
<p>
The final report should be a well-presented technical report discussing
your project.  You should explain how the program works, give specific
sample runs and analyze the results.  Results indicating the relative
efficiency of your protocol with varying error percentages are encouraged.
The final report may include parts of your design report.  The report
should be 5-10 pages in length.
</p><p>
</p></li></ol><h2><a name="SECTION00008000000000000000">Grading</a></h2>
<p>
Projects will be turned using <em>turnin</em> with ``proj2'' and tested for
grading.  The final report will also be examined as part of the grade.
Projects will be graded based on features and correctness.  Correctly
implemented projects using the ``stop and wait'' protocol will generally
receive grades in the B range.  Correctly implemented projects
using the ``go back n'' and ``selective repeat'' protocols will generally
receive grades in the low A range.  Correctly implemented projects
that allow both sending and receiving of files along with buffering in the
data link layer and/or actual framing of data will generally receive A
grades.  Variation in grades will depend on the quality of the work,
features provided, the analyses that were done and the final report.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00009000000000000000">Final Comments</a></h2>
<p>
This document outlines the project and a lot of the details on how to
design and build it.  You should be familiar with TCP/IP from the previous
assignment and should begin in a simple manner by writing routines for
transmitting data link information over the TCP/IP connection.  From this
start you can go on to more complex issues.
</p><p>
The project provides you latitude on how it is designed and implemented.
Not all details are spelled out for you.  Part of the assignment is to test
how well you can take a more open design project and turn it into a
finished product.  Do not wait to get started and do not wait until the
project design deadline to start coding.  You have many decisions to make
and much work to do.
</p><p>
You will obviously want to consult the data link layer protocols in the
textbook for this assignment, although you probably do not want to use the
code verbatim.  Tanenbaum has made the data link layer protocol code
available online at a Web site and included it as part of a simulation
readers can obtain.  The contents of this Web site have been downloaded to
the directory <code>/cs/cs4514/pub/dllsim</code> for your perusal.  Look at the
<tt>README</tt> file in the directory as a starting point.  This simulation
does not actually transfer data as your simulation must.  It also is more
complex in the parameters it uses than your simulation needs to be.  This
simulation and its code are made available for you to consult.  It is not
suggested that you try to use this simulation code directly in your
project.  Any parts you do use should be documented in your design report
and final project.
