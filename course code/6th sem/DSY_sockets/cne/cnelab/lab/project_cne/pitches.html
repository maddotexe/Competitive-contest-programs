					Many users like to root their smart-phones, with an emphasis on
					Android and iPhone devices. Rooting exposes features that are locked
					down by carriers, such as tethering and innovative applications.
					However, rooting also carries security risks, as it compromises the
					mobile operating system's application isolation mechanisms. This
					project will focus on the Android OS, and will look at the application
					isolation isses. A particularly interesting issue is the SD card,
					which is used for shared storage by applications, and doesn't have
					any isolation mechanisms in place (uses a FAT32 filesystem).

					CAPTCHAs are used to distinguish between human users and computers,
					hoping to reduce the abuse (like spam) on open systems. Currently,
					CAPTCHAs rely on the hardness of the OCR problem. Sadly, automated
					recognizers have made great strides in this area, which means that
					CAPTCHAs are becoming increasingly difficult, and thus frustrating for
					human users to solve. This project is looking at new methods for
					CAPTCHAs, relying on the difficulty of object and feature recognition
					in images (e.g. recognize a rotation of a 3-D object, or pictures of
					a room from different angles).

					Interested in two aspects of P2P security: the search index and the

					A compromised compiler can insert trojans into the binary it outputs.
					This is problematic, because the security issue cannot be detected

					Finger-print readers are an increasingly popular method of biometric
