<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to 
develop a simple peer to peer file sharing system that uses a centralized 
directory server. This project consists of and is delivered in three stages: a 
survey paper discussing different existing P2P architectures for file sharing; a 
detailed design of of the system to be implemented including its protocols; and 
the final demonstration of the working system. The overall architecture of the system will be similar to that 
of the original Napster, as shown below. </p>
	<p>
<img style="border: medium none;" src="CS490-FA10-project_files/architecture90.gif" alt="" height="331" width="511"></p>
	<p>We assume that this system can be used to share MP3 files. Each peer is uniquely identified by the name of its 
host computer; each host has a unique IP address. The system consists of a 
centralized directory server and a number of peers; each peer combines a 
functionality of a P2P client and a transient P2P server. In our system, the P2P 
client can acts as the client to the directory server to obtain information 
about available files; it also acts as the client of a P2P transient server in 
order to obtain desired files. Therefore, this project consists of two major 
parts: implementation of the communication protocol between the directory server 
and a P2P client, and implementation of the communication protocol between a P2P 
client and a transient P2P server. </p>
				<p>This project is adapted from a
<a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/%7Ecs430/notes/Project/P2P2.html">similar 
project</a> offered at University of Manitoba, Canada</p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>
The description below outlines the minimum requirements for this course project. 
Students are encouraged to implement features that go above and beyond those 
described here. However, resulting systems must meet (or exceed) all requirements 
presented in this document. </p>
	<p>
Additional requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You must work in teams of two or three students;</li>
		<li>You may use any programming language (or combination 
		thereof) to implement this project;</li>
		<li>You must use sockets to implement client/server 
		communication.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Directory server and its interaction 
with P2P client </h2>

<p>The centralized directory server maintains a directory of MP3 
files which users are willing to share. It contains entries which list MP3 
file name, file size, and the host name where the file resides. When a user, say 
Bob, wants to advertise a file for sharing, he sends a complete directory 
entry to the directory server using an "Inform and update" message. This message 
is sent using UDP. The directory server acknowledges the "inform and 
update" message. A user can send multiple entries in one message and end them 
with CR LF characters, similar to the format of the header lines in an HTTP 
request message shown below. </p>
	<p>
	<img style="border: medium none;" alt="" src="CS490-FA10-project_files/requestFormat90.gif" height="256" width="497"></p>
	<p>When a client wants to exit from this application, 
it sends an "exit" message upon receiving which the server deletes the 
entries associated with this client and sends an acknowledgement to the client. 
When a P2P client wants to get some content from its peers, it sends a 
"query for content" message to the directory server specifying the file name or 
asking for a directory listing from the directory server. All messages sent to 
the directory server can resemble the HTTP request message. For example you can 
have "inform and update", "query" and "exit" in the method field. In the so 
called URL and version fields you can put client's host name and address. In 
each header line, you can put file name in the header field name field and file 
size in the value field. The directory server should be multi-threaded and 
should handle concurrent writings to the media file directory. </p>
	<p>When the directory server replies to a P2P client, 
it uses the format similar to the HTTP response message. The format of the 
HTTP response message is shown in the figure below. </p>
	<p>
	<img style="border: medium none;" alt="" src="CS490-FA10-project_files/responseFormat90.gif" height="257" width="492"></p>
	<p>The version field can be 
omitted. A status code and a status phrase are used to acknowledge the various 
request messages sent by clients. At least two status codes (and corresponding 
phrases) must be implemented. These are 200 (OK) and 400 (ERROR). Other status 
codes may be defined (please describe them in your system documentation). When 
acknowledging a "query" request, directory entries in the query result can be 
transmitted using the header lines. Each header line contains an entry for a 
file that is stored on a peer; both file name and file size are included. </p>
	<h2>Protocol requirements between P2P client and directory server </h2>
	<p>For messages 
exchanged between the directory server and a P2P client, we assume that the 
maximum transfer unit (MTU) size of 128 bytes. Therefore you need to segment 
longer messages into smaller packets. Make sure that packets can be re-assembled 
into original message at the destination. For messages sent to the directory 
server, each packet must contain a first line which indicates the host name 
and address of the sending client, this way the directory server can recognize 
which client this packet was sent from. In order to implement reliability we 
will need acknowledgements and time-outs for individual packets. Each packet has 
to be acknowledged which means that an "ACK" message has to be implemented. This 
also means that packets need to have sequence numbers. </p>
	<p>The protocol handles lost 
packets by having the sender of the data packets use a timeout with 
retransmission. If a data packet is lost, the sender eventually times out and 
retransmits the packet. If an acknowledgment packet is lost, the sender of the 
data packet still times out and retransmits the data packet. In this case the 
receiver of the data packets notes from the block sequence number in the data 
packet that it is a duplicate, so it ignores the duplicate of the data packet 
and retransmits the acknowledgement. </p>
	<p>There is a subtle problem in the above 
specification of the protocol. If both the sender and receiver use a timeout 
with retransmission, and both retransmit whatever they last sent, a condition 
termed the sorcerer's apprentice syndrome results (see RFC 1123). Actually, with 
the above scheme, when a time-out occurs (say because the ACK was delayed in the 
network), every further data packet and acknowledgement packet will be sent 
twice. The correction to this syndrome is for the sender never to retransmit a 
data packet if it receives a duplicate acknowledgement. </p>
	<p>In order to determine 
the time-out interval you should use the round-trip time estimation procedure 
outlined in the section 3.5.3 of the text book. Please use parameters alpha and 
beta from the book and also assume that initial EstimatedRTT=100ms. </p>
	<h2>P2P client 
and its interaction with P2P server </h2>
	<p>A P2P client is a client of both the 
directory server and the P2P server. The P2P client provides a text-based 
user interface for a user to interact with the directory server. This is the 
	minimal requirement and you are encouraged to implement a client with a nice 
	GUI. With this 
interface, commands such as "inform", "query", and "exit" are issued 
	and responses 
returned from the directory server are displayed. A user can then select a 
server from a list of P2P servers that have a desired file, and issue the HTTP 
GET command to retrieve desired MP3 files from the selected P2P server. </p>
	<p>No particular format is enforced on how to maintain the database of MP3 file entries 
at the directory server. Similarly, no particular format is enforced for 
the query results of a directory listing request. However, the choices of these 
	formats must be documented in the system documentation (detailed below), 
	which must clearly describe how to use 
	the user interface to issue commands or to select a P2P server in the user 
documentation. </p>
	<p>HTTP 1.1, as defined in RFC 2616, will be used to 
	transmit MP3 files between a P2P client and a P2P server. Separate HTTP requests are 
sent for each MP3 file desired. A P2P server will be able to handle multiple 
simultaneous requests in parallel. This means that the P2P server must be 
multi-threaded. In the main thread, the server listens to a fixed port. When it 
receives a TCP connection request, it creates a new TCP socket and services the 
request in a separate thread. The subset of HTTP 1.1 functionalities needed in 
this project is </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Only GET request needs to be implemented. The URL 
		field in GET method contains the name of the requested file;</li>
		<li>The server must implement HTTP 
code 200, 400, 404 and 505 correctly.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Port number assignment </h2>
	<p>The same port number must be used for both the 
directory server and the P2P server (because they use different protocols, 
namely UDP and TCP respectively, this would not be a problem even when the two 
servers are running on the same host). Each student team will be assigned a unique port 
number upon our receiving team information. Before then, feel free to 
use a port that is not widely used on the Internet. Please refer to section "About 
port numbers" below. </p>
	<h2>Other aspects </h2>
	<p>The basic ingredients for your code for TCP 
and UDP are given in sections 2.7 and 2.8 in the textbook respectively. These 
	are written in Java and you are welcome to use them if you choose Java for 
	implementation.</p>
	<h2>About port numbers </h2>
	<p>At any given time, multiple processes can use either UDP or 
TCP. Both 
TCP and UDP use 16-bit integer <i>port numbers</i> to differentiate between these 
processes. Both TCP and UDP define a group of well known ports to identify 
well-known services. For example, every TCP/IP implementation that supports FTP 
assigns well-known port of 21 (decimal) to the FTP server. TFTP servers, for the 
Trivial File Transfer Protocol, are assigned the UDP port of 69. </p>
	<p>Clients on the 
other hand, use <i>ephemeral ports</i>, that is short-lived ports. These port numbers 
are normally assigned automatically by TCP or UDP to the client. Clients 
normally do not care about the value of the ephemeral port; the client just 
needs to be certain that the ephemeral port is unique on the client host. The 
TCP and UDP codes guarantee this uniqueness. </p>
	<p>RFC 1700 contains the list of port 
number assignments from the Internet Assigned Authority (IANA). However, usually 
the file <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">port number</a> is more up-to-date than RFC 1700. The port numbers are divided into three ranges: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <i>well-known 
ports</i>: 0 through 1023. These port numbers are controlled and assigned by IANA. 
When possible the same port is assigned to a given server for both TCP and UDP. 
For example, port 80 is assigned for a Web server, for both protocols, even 
though all implementations currently use only TCP.</li>
		<li>The <i>registered ports</i>: 1024 
through 49151. These are not controlled by the IANA, but the IANA registers and 
lists the uses of these ports as a convenience to the community. When possible 
the same port is assigned to a given service for both TCP and UDP. For example, 
ports 6000 through 6063 are assigned for an X Window server for both protocols, 
even though all implementations currently use only TCP. The upper limit of 49151 
for these ports is new, as RFC 1700 lists the upper range as 65535 (FYI only). </li>
		<li>The <i>dynamic</i> or <i>private ports</i>, 49152 through 65535. The IANA says nothing about 
these ports. These are what we call <i>ephemeral</i> ports. </li>
