	<h3> <font color="#8A2908">Project 2</font> </h3>
             <b>DUE DATE: April 12, 2013 (11:59pm) </b> <br>

	<h3> <font color="#8A2908"> Description </font> </h3>
        <p align="justify"> In this assignment you will be asked to 
implement two Reliable Data Transmission Protocols. This project will be
 completed using C/C++ over a network emulator already provided. No 
knowledge of Unix system calls will be needed to complete this project.</p>

	<h3> <font color="#8A2908">Details </font> </h3>
         <p> 
	 </p><ol>
	   <li> Detailed <b>project description</b> can be found <b><a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/%7Ekven/courses/cs3516-d13/Projects/project_2_desc.html">here</a></b> </li>
	   <li> In this laboratory programming assignment, you will be writing 
the sending and receiving transport-level code for implementing a simple
 reliable data transfer protocol </li>
           <li> Your code will have to execute in a simulated 
hardware/software environment. Programming interface provided to your 
routines, i.e., the code that would call your entities from above and 
from below is very close to what is done in an actual UNIX environment. 
Stopping/starting of timers are also simulated, and timer interrupts 
will cause your timer handling routine to be activated </li>
	   <li> There are two phases to this lab. Phase 1: Alternating-Bit-Protocol version and Phase 2: Go-Back-N version </li>
	   <li> This assignment is worth - <b> 100 points </b></li>
	   <li> Make sure you read the "helpful hints" and Q/A section in project description </li>
	</ol>
	<p>

	</p><h3> <font color="#8A2908">Submission </font> </h3> 
	<p> As a part of the submission you need to provide the following: 
        <br> <b>For Phase 1, create a zip file "your-wpi-login_project2_phase1.zip"</b>
	</p><ol>
           <li> All the code for the alternating-bit protocol (any 
.c/.c++ and .h files), including any code that was pre-provided as part 
of this project</li>
	   <li> A ReadMe (txt) file that spells out exactly how to compile and run the code</li>	          
           <li> A PDF document with state-machine diagram and description for the sender and receiver for Phase 1</li>
           <li> A PDF document with the output trace as described in the project description</li>
	</ol>
	<b>For Phase 2, create a zip file "your-wpi-login_project2_phase2.zip"</b>
	<ol>
           <li> All the code for the go-back-n protocol (any .c/.c++ and
 .h files), including any code that was pre-provided as part of this 
project</li>
	   <li> A ReadMe (txt) file that spells out exactly how to compile and run the code</li>	          
           <li> A PDF document with the output trace as described in the project description</li>
	</ol>
	Combine (via zip or tar) the two zip files for the two phases up into a single archive file named "<b>your-wpi-login_project2.zip</b>". <p>
 Submit your document electronically via Instruct Assist 
(http://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/cs3516) by 11:59pm on the day the assignment 
is due. Make sure you choose "Project 2" under project drop-down in IA 
before uploading the zip file. </p>
		
	<h3> <font color="#8A2908">Grading </font> </h3> 
	<p> Grade breakup (%) assuming all documents are present: </p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Functioning Alternating Bit-Protocol (RDT3.0) code = 30% </li>
	  <li> Alternating Bit-Protocol (RDT3.0) design document with state-machines diagram and description = 10% </li>
	  <li> Alternating Bit-Protocol (RDT3.0) output trace  = 10% </li>
	  <li> Functioning Go-Back-N Protocol code = 40% </li>
	  <li> Go-Back-N output trace (as explained in the project description) = 10% </li>
	</ol>
	
	<p> The grade will be a ZERO if: 
        </p><ol>
	  <li> If the code (phase 1 or phase 2) does not compile or gives a run-time error </li>
	  <li> If README with detailed instructions on compiling the running the code is not present </li> 
	</ol>
