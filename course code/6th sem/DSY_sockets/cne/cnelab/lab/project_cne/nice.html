</p><h2><em>Objective</em></h2>

<p> The Internet is experiencing the widespread adoption of
applications that support real-time reliable or unreliable
distribution of multimedia information to multiple destinations (e.g.,
<i>nv, vat, NeVot, wb</i> and <i> shdr</i>). In addition, with the
continuing decrease in hardware costs, very simple or special-purpose
devices will soon have computing and communications capabilities of
their own and enjoy Internetwork addressability traditionally assigned
to mainframes, workstations, and more recently personal computers. As
a result, very simple devices will become reachedable through the
Internet; furthermore, traditional computing, storage, and
media-distribution resources will be implementable by aggregating such
simpler devices (e.g., a traditional Internet host becomes a network
of devices). We refer to this next architectural step in the evolution
of the Internet as the <i>networked imbedded-computing environment</i>
(NICE). NICE implies the interconnection to the national information
infrastructure of vast numbers of internetwork-addressable devices and
traditional networked resources.

</p><p> The emergence of NICE and new Internet real-time multimedia
applications presents many new challenges on multicasting and routing.
UCSC is carrying out a three-year research project focusing on
reliable multicasting, multicast routing, scalable routing, and
congestion control.

<p>
</p><h2><em>Approach</em></h2>

<p> Our approach consisted of advancing the state of the art in the
following areas:

</p><ul> 

<li><p> <i> End-to-End Reliable Multicast:</i> Protocols that support
scalable and reliable many-to-many communication on an end-to-end
basis and eliminate the limitations of existing sender-initiated and
receiver-initiated multicast protocols.  The proposed protocols
operate by the sources delegating retransmission responsibilities to
the receivers, and by organizing the receivers of a session in a
structure that reduces the number of acknowledgments flowing back to
the sources.


</p></li><li><p> <i>Many-Cast Routing Architecture (MARA):</i> We propose a
novel scalable routing architecture and algorithms to support unicast,
multicast, and `any-cast' routing. This architecture is based on the
notion of GDAGs, which generalizes the notion of multicast trees used
in all previous approaches to multicasting and can support security
requirements in a scalable manner.  GDAGs can be viewed as multicast
trees extended by added chords, so that a single GDAG services all the
sources of a multicast group and reduces the dealy/length/cost of the
paths from sources to receivers with respect to what a single
multicast tree per group can provide.


</p></li><li><p> <i>Reliable Multicast within The Network:</i> Protocols that
support reliable multicast within the network for such network-control
purposes as key distribution or reliable updates among routers or
switches.  These protocols either establish a <i> group-oriented
directed acyclic graph</i> (GDAG) or use diffusing computations to
carry out reliable multicast `on the fly.' [This may be necessary, for
example in distributed simulation networks with such mobile nodes as
aircraft.]
        
</p></li><li><p> <i> Integrated Routing:</i> Routing algorithms in MARA 
extend the techniques developed for link-vector algorithms and other
types of algorithms to manage routing objects corresponding to links,
nodes, distances to nodes, flows between nodes, or ATM virtual-path
and virtual-channel layouts.
</p></li></ul>

<p>

<p>
</p><h2><em>Recent Accomplishments</em></h2>

<p> There are several mechanisms defined to protect the communication
across links between neighboring nodes.  However, today's Internet
routing and multicasting protocols provide few mechanisms, if any, to
protect the exchange of control information. This project has
developed the only known method to secure both classes of information
in distance-vector routing protocols in constant space, which means
that the overhead of the security mechanism is only linear with
respect to the number of destinations.  This method was applied to BGP
and intra-domain routing protocols.

</p><p> A new hierarchical routing algorithm was developed, which is
called the Hierarchical Information Path-based Routing (HIPR)
algorithm. HIPR is based on the incremental exchange of hierarchical
routing trees, and can be viewed as the first distributed version of
Dijkstra's SPF algorithm running over a hierarchical graph. It has
been shown that HIPR is far more efficient than OSPF in terms of time
to converge, control messages exchanged, and computational overhead.

</p><p> Prior specifications of the Core Based Tree (CBT) protocol have
been shown to produce undetected loops and fail to construct multicast
routing trees. To address the limitations of CBT, the Ordered Core
based Tree (OCBT) protocol has been proposed.  The Multicast Internet
Protocol (MIP) was also developed, which is free of loops at every
instant and incurs far less overhead than PIM. MIP's design is based
on the use of diffusing computations to distribute state information
among routers regarding group membership along an acyclic graph.

</p><p> End-to-end reliable multicast protocols that organize the set of
receivers into a tree have been shown to be far more scalable and
support higher maximum throughput than any other type of reliable
multicast protocol proposed to date, such as sender initiated,
receiver initiated, or ring-based protocols.

</p><p> The Lorax protocol has been developed, which is the first known
protocol that constructs and maintains a single shared acknowledgment
(ACK) tree for concurrent reliable multicasting. Lorax eliminates the
need to maintain an ACK tree for each source of a reliable multicast
group, and can be used in combination with any of several tree-based
reliable multicast protocols proposed to date.  Lorax provides
solutions to several open questions concerning the implementation of
shared ACK trees. Preserving reliability during restructuring of the
ACK tree is easily guaranteed using aggregated acknowledgments that
propagate from each leaf towards the source.  Lorax constructs and
maintains a shared ACK tree.  Overhead traffic is contained during
initial ACK-tree construction by growing the ACK tree from a known
root.  Impatient nodes are quieted down and allowed to join the ACK
tree by means of expanded ring searches that are narrow in
scope. Hierarchical labeling of each node makes implicit routing of
acknowledgments simple and preserves loop-free routing of such
acknowledgments over the ACK tree at all times.


</p><p> Architectural improvements to IP-multicast have been developed to
encourage communication and cooperation between IP and higher-layer
protocols.  The first, called LMAS, is a generalization of
internetwork multicasting. LMAS provides an extended set of semantics
so that sources can restrict the delivery of packets to a subset of
information. LMAS can be implemented using CBT or PIM. The second
architecture, called Streams, allows higher-layer protocols place
packets into application-defined logical streams, so that hosts may
prune the routing of packets based on meaningful contexts. The third
architecture, called RMA, introduces new routing services designed to
support reliable multicast protocols.  The cooperation between RMA and
reliable multicast protocols provides very scalable and efficient
reliable communication among hosts, and allows SRM, Lorax, and other
reliable protocols to cooperate across an internet by providing a
common interface.

</p><p> A new multicast routing architecture called Shared-Tree
Hierarchical Inter-Domain Multicast (SHIM) has been developed, which
allows the use of shared tree protocols such as PIM-SM or CBT as the
inter-domain routing protocol in a hierarchy that can include any
routing protocol at the lowest level.  The architecture consists of
two protocols: one that encapsulates an entire routing domain to allow
it to appear as a {\it virtual router} on a higher-level shared tree;
and a second protocol that provides mechanisms for rendezvous point or
core distribution and recursively applies the first protocol to
produce trees of domains that contain trees of domains. SHIM differs
from existing hierarchical multicast protocols in many ways. It is the
first architecture to allow any multicast protocol at the lowest level
while using a shared tree for higher-level routing. It provides a
simple, efficient mechanism for RP or core location
dissemination. SHIM aligns easily with existing unicast domains and it
does not require explicit assignment of levels except at the highest
level.  SHIM is suitable for any shared tree protocol, such as PIM-SM
or CBT, that forms a tree by sending join messages to some central
router. It can also provide additional robustness for the shared tree
protocol through the ability to replace a single rendezvous point or
core with several routers that operate together in a distributed
fashion and can tolerate members failing.

</p><p> The Scalable Routing Information Protocol (SCRIP) has been
implemented based on the loop-free path finding algorithm developed
earlier in this project. SCRIP was implemented in gated and imports
and exports routes from RIP. SCRIP has been debugged and tested and is
running in a network of five PC routers. SCRIP converges as fast or
faster than OSPF after network changes and requires an order of
magnitude less load on the routers.

</p><h2><em>Technology Transition</em></h2>

<p> The limitations of CBT were notified to members of the IETF. A new
version of CBT has been released by Ballardi, which corrects most of
the limitations identified by our analysis.

</p><p> Collaboration with Bell Laboratories took place
to implement some
of the mechanisms introduced in Lorax as part of the Reliable
Multicast Transport Protocol.
