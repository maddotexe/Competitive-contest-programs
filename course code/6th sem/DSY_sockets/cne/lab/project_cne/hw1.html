</h1>
<h3>Objective</h3>
The original design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) worked
reliably, but was unable to provide acceptable performance
in&nbsp;large and congested networks. Several TCP variants have been
proposed since then (TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, Vegas and SACK) with
mechanisms to control and avoid congestion. The objective of this
homework is for you to analyze the performance of these different TCP
variants.&nbsp; You will use the NS-2 network simulator to perform
experiments that will help you understand the behavior of the TCP
variants under various load conditions and queuing algorithms. &nbsp;
Before starting the assignment, you will need to familiarize yourself
with NS-2 with the information on this <a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/%7Eravenben/classes/276/introns.html">page</a>.
<br>
<br>
Another objective of this assignment is for you to practice performance
evaluation. In order to perform a complete analysis of the TCP
variants, you should first read the paper: "Simulation-based
Comparisons of Tahoe, Reno and SACK TCP" (<a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/%7Eravenben/classes/276/papers/tcp-sim.pdf">PDF</a>)
to understand what type of analysis you are required to do. &nbsp;The
paper also includes details on the relevant TCP variants used in this
assignment.<br>
<h3>Assignment</h3>
In this assignment, you will analyze the performance of TCP
variants (Reno, NewReno, and Vegas) under the influence of
various load conditions and queuing algorithms. In the first part of
the assignment, you will perform experiments that analyze fairness
between these TCP variants in the presence of a Constant Bit Rate (CBR)
flow.&nbsp; In the second part of the assignment, you will understand
the behavior of the TCP variants under the influence of two different
queuing disciplines (DropTail and RED). <br>
<h3>Part 1 - Fairness between TCP variants</h3>
To study the behavior of the four TCP variants, you need to first set
up a network topology. Use the following topology with 10Mbits on all
links.<br>
                                
<pre>                         N1                      N4
                           \                    /
                            \                  /
                             N2--------------N3
                            /                  \
                           /                    \
                         N5                      N6
</pre>

<br>
Add a CBR source at N2 and a sink at N3. Next, add two TCP streams from
N1 to N4 and N5 to N6. Graph the average packet loss rate and the
average bandwidth used by all three flows as a function of the
bandwidth used by the CBR flow. That is, the CBR flow is the parameter
you need to vary for this experiment. You must repeat the experiment
using the following TCP variants (one variant creating traffic from N1
to N4, and the other creating traffic from N5 to N6):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Reno/Reno </li>
  <li>NewReno/Reno</li>
  <li>Vegas/Vegas</li> 
  <li>NewReno/Vegas</li>
</ul>
Next, remove one TCP stream and analyze how a single flow of each TCP
variant reacts to an increasing CBR flow. Perform the experiments with
Reno, NewReno, and Vegas.<br>
<h3>Part 2 - Influence of Queuing</h3>
Queuing disciplines like DropTail and Random Early Drop (RED) are
algorithms that control how packets in a queue are treated. Instead of 
varying the rate of the CBR flow, we will now study the influence of
the queuing discipline used at the node on the overall throughput.
<ol>
  <li> Use the same topology from Part1 and have one TCP flow (N1-N4) and one CBR/UDP (N5-N6) flow.
First, start the TCP flow. Once the TCP flow is steady, start the CBR
source and analyze how the TCP and CBR flows change under the following
queuing algorithms: DropTail and RED. Perform the experiments with TCP
Reno and SACK. Answer the following questions for Reno and for SACK:<br>Simulate the following scenario under two queuing algorithms: One
TCP flow (test with Reno and SACK) sending 1000 bytes packets, and one
UDP flow sending 500 bytes packets at a rate of 1 Mbps. The middle link
they are sharing is a 1.5Mbps link. How do results change? Why?</li>
  <li>Consider three UDP flows sharing a 1.5 Mbps link (See figure below): 
The first two UDP flows are sending 1000 byte packets at 1 Mbps, and the last UDP
flow is sending 500 byte packets at 0.6 Mbps. Assume that the flows
start sending at 0sec, 0.1sec, and 0.2sec, respectively. Plot the
throughput of all three flows. Explain the results. Measure the average
packet latency (end-to-end delay) for the packets for different flows
and plot it. How does it differ between DropTail and RED?</li>
  <li>Does each queuing discipline provide fair bandwidth to each flow?
How does the TCP flow react to the creation of the CBR flow? Is RED a
good idea while dealing with SACK? </li>
</ol>
<pre>                         N1                      N4
                           \                    /
                            \                  /
                    N7------N2--------------N3--------N8
                            /                  \
                           /                    \
                         N5                      N6
</pre>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span><br>
To prepare you to complete this assignment, you should write scripts
that parse the trace files and enable you to report average bandwidth,
packet drops, throughput, end-to-end latency, sequence numbers of
packets sent, and TCP congestion window of any flow. You will use these
scripts to extract the information you will need to answer the above
questions. You need to understand the format of the TCP output file to
successfully write these scripts.<br>
