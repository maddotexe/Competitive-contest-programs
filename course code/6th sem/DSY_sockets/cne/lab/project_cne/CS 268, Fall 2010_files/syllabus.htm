<h3>CS 268, Fall 2010: Course Project</h3>
</center>

  You will divide into teams of up to three (preferable two) to carry out
the term project.  Your term project can be either of the following types:
design/implementation, measurement, analysis, and simulation. The goal of
the project is to experiment with <b>new</b> research ideas and solutions.
You should aim for a conference quality work.  
<p> I will distribute a list of possible research projects in class. However,
you are encouraged to come up with your own project ideas.</p>

<p> <b>Project proposal</b>  
Once you decide on your project, you will be asked to write a <b>one 
page</b> project proposal that should clearly state:  </p>

<ul>
 <li> the problem you are solving  </li>
  <li> motivations (if this is your own idea) and challenges; why is this
problem important and difficult?</li>
  <li>your proposed solution or approach and why it's new,  </li>
  <li> your plan of attack with milestones and dates, and</li>
  <li> any resources you might need so we can take care of this early on
in the semester.</li>

   
</ul>
 I will provide written feedback on the project proposals either via email
or in person.  Feel free to drop by office hours to discuss and develop your
project ideas further. 

<p> <b>Porject report</b> The project report should not exceed 10
single column pages, and the font size should be at least 11pt.

</p><p> Note that in addition to writing the report and giving the final
presentation, you will be asked to give a ten minute
<b>presentation</b> before the spring break about the status of your
project. This talk should not exceed seven minutes, with three minutes
for comments and questions. </p>
