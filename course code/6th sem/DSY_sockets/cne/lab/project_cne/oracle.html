</p><h1><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000">Accessing User Services using Dynamic Binding</a></h1>
<p>
This assignment serves as an introduction to client-server programming
using the TCP/IP protocols. In this assignment, you will write both a
client and a server.  Your client and server will communicate using
TCP, and your server may implement any service you choose.  The ground
rules are simple: the server reads and writes data to and from the TCP
connection.  The server may prompt the client for input, or simply
print a random message. Once you have debugged the server, it executes
in background (even after you log out) waiting for service requests
from a client.
</p><p>
To access a service, the client opens a TCP connection to the server, sends
and receives data, and then closes the connection.  Conceptually, the
client acts as a pipe between your terminal and the server, copying data
sent by the server to standard output and sending data read from standard
input to the server.  The client terminates the connection with the server
when it receives an end-of-file from either the server or standard input.
</p><p>
The above scenario omits a key aspect of client-server programming: How
does the client find out <i>where</i> the server is? That is, what
transport-level address (Internet address and port number) should the
client connect to?
</p><p>
One solution is to use a name server that dynamically maps service
names into their transport-level addresses. We will supply you with a
such a server, called <i>oracle</i>, allowing you to register the
service you provide and advertise it to other students in the class.
Conceptually, the <i>oracle</i> is like the white pages in your phone
book.  A server registers the name and transport address of its
service in the phone book, and clients use the phone book to map
service names to transport addresses.
</p><p>
When your server starts, the operating system will assign it an unused port
number (e.g., XXX) on which it can wait for incoming connection requests.
The server then advertises the availability of its service by sending a
short message to the <i>oracle</i> containing the name of the service (e.g.,
``daytime'') together with the transport address (host number and port
XXX). The oracle server records the name-to-address mapping in its local
database.
</p><p>
When a client wishes to connect to a server, it first sends a message
containing the desired service name (e.g., ``daytime'') to the <i>
oracle</i>, and the oracle returns a message with the appropriate transport
address (e.g., XXX).  The client then opens a TCP connection to that
service.  Exact details for communicating with the <i>oracle</i> are
described below.
</p><p>
</p><h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000">Client-Server Overview</a></h1>
<p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00021000000000000000">Client</a></h2>
<p>
The client accepts the following set of commands from standard input:
</p><dl><dt><strong><i>list</i></strong><i>
</i></dt><dd><i>: Send a message to the <i>oracle</i> requesting a
listing of all the services currently available.
</i></dd><dt><i><strong><i>connect service</i></strong><i>
</i></i></dt><dd><i><i> <i>[uid]</i>: Open a connection to the server providing
service <i>service</i>. <i>Service</i> is the user-friendly service name
registered with the <i>oracle</i>.  An optional argument <i>uid</i> is
used to distinguish between services provided by different users
having the same name.  That is, multiple users may register services
having the same name.
</i></i></dd><dt><i><i><strong><i>quit</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: terminate the client program.
<p>
 </p></i></i></i></dd></dl><i><i><i>
<p>
When the client wishes to connect to a server, it traces the following
steps:
</p><ol><p></p><li> Contact the <i>oracle</i> to find the transport-level address (host
 name and port number) of the service you are trying to locate
(details below).<p></p></li><li> Open a TCP connection to the server supplying the desired service.<p></p></li><li> Copy standard input to the server, and copy all data sent by the
server to standard output.<p></p></li><li> After receiving an end-of-file from <i>either</i> standard input
or the TCP connection, close the TCP connection.  Note: if your client
receives an end-of-file from standard input, it should terminate the
connection to the server, but should continue reading additional
commands from standard input because the user may want to connect to
another service (see <i>clearerr(3)</i>).
</li></ol></i></i></i><h2><a name="SECTION00022000000000000000">Server</a></h2>
<p>
The server traces the following steps when making a service available:
</p><p>
</p><ol><p></p><li> Create a TCP socket (similar to a  UNIX file descriptor -- see
<i>socket(2)</i>.)<p></p></li><li> Bind the socket to a <i>sockaddr_in</i> structure with family AF_INET,
port number 0, and address INADDR_ANY.  This directs the Unix kernel to
accept TCP connection requests from any machine (INADDR_ANY) in the
Internet, and specifying a port number of 0 (meaning ``don't care'')
directs the kernel to allocate an unused port number (see <i>
bind(2)</i>).<p></p></li><li> Extract the port number allocated in the previous step (see
<i>getsockname(2)</i>), and fetch the Internet address of the host on
which your server resides (see <i>gethostname(2) and <i>
gethostbyname(3)</i></i>.  Fill in the appropriate fields in the <i>om</i>
structure (described below) and register the service with <i>
oracle</i>.<p></p></li><li> Specify the backlog of incoming connection requests you are
willing to tolerate (see <i>listen(2)</i>).<p></p></li><li> Finally, wait for a connection request and service it.  When you
have serviced the request, repeat the process by waiting for the next
connection attempt (see <i>accept(2)</i>, and <i>close(2)</i>).
</li></ol><h1><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000">Interacting With Oracle</a></h1>
<p>
<i>Oracle</i> resides on machine <i>garden</i> at well-known UDP port <i>
netoracle</i>.  All communication with <i>oracle</i> is through UDP messages
containing a structure called an <i>om</i> (for ``oracle message'',
pronounced ``ohhmm''), whose definition can be found in the file <tt>
oracle.h</tt> in <tt>/cs/cs4514/pub/lib</tt>. The file is reproduced
below:
</p><p>

};
# define lom (sizeof (struct om))</tt></pre>
<p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00031000000000000000">Locating a Service</a></h2>
<p>
To find a service, your client program fills in the fields of the <i>
om</i> structure as follows:
</p><dl><dt><strong><i>ver</i></strong><i>
</i></dt><dd><i>: Always <i>verCur</i> in all messages.
</i></dd><dt><i><strong><i>cmd</i></strong><i>
</i></i></dt><dd><i><i>: <i>cmdGet</i>.
</i></i></dd><dt><i><i><strong><i>uid</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: The Unix user id of the user offering the service.
If the client doesn't care which <i>uid</i> to use, it sets this field
to the NULL string (NULL character in first byte).
</i></i></i></dd><dt><i><i><strong><i>sbServ</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: The name of the service being searched for (filled
in by the client).  To get a listing of all available services, set
<i>sbServ</i> to the NULL string (NULL character in first byte).
<p>
 </p></i></i></i></dd></dl><i><i>
<p>
In response to a <i>cmdGet</i> message, <i>oracle</i> returns two or
more messages.  Response messages have a <i>cmd</i> type of <i>
cmdAckGet</i>, and the end of <i>cmdAck</i> responses is signaled by a
<i>cmdEnd</i> message. <i>CmdEnd</i> messages do not contain the name of
a service; they simply signal the end the last response.
If only one service matches the client's
request, the server will return two messages: a <i>cmdAckGet</i>,
followed by a <i>cmdEnd</i>.  Each <i>cmdAck</i> message contains the
following fields:
</p><dl><dt><strong><i>sbDesc</i></strong><i>
</i></dt><dd><i>: A sentence describing the service.  Your server uses
this field when registering a service, and the <i>oracle</i> returns it
in response to <i>cmdGet</i> queries.  When locating a service, the
field should contain all zeros.
</i></dd><dt><i><strong><i>uid</i></strong><i>
</i></i></dt><dd><i><i>: The user id providing the service (e.g, ``cew'')
</i></i></dd><dt><i><i><strong><i>sbServ</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: The name of the service (e.g., ``daytime'').
</i></i></i></dd><dt><i><i><i><strong><i>sa</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: The transport address at which the service resides. 
</i></i></i></dd><dt><i><i><i><strong><i>ti</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: The time at which the service was registered.
<p>
 </p></i></i></i></dd></dl></i></i><h2><a name="SECTION00032000000000000000">Registering a Service with  Oracle</a></h2>
<p>
When the server wishes to register a service with the <i>oracle</i>, it
sends an <i>om</i> message with the following fields:
</p><dl><dt><strong><i>cmd</i></strong><i>
</i></dt><dd><i>: <i>cmdPut</i>, to register a service.
</i></dd><dt><i><strong><i>uid</i></strong><i>
</i></i></dt><dd><i><i>: The login id of the user registering the service (see
<i>getuid(2)</i> and <i>getpwent(3)</i>).
</i></i></dd><dt><i><i><strong><i>sbServ</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: One word name of the service (e.g., ``daytime'').
</i></i></i></dd><dt><i><i><i><strong><i>sbDesc</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: A brief description of the service.
</i></i></i></dd><dt><i><i><i><strong><i>sa</i></strong><i>
</i></i></i></i></dt><dd><i><i><i>: The transport level address at which the server can be reached.
<p>
 </p></i></i></i></dd></dl><i><i><i>
<p>
In response to a <i>cmdPut</i> message, <i>oracle</i> returns a message
of type <i>cmdAckPut</i> if the registration succeeds.  In the case of
errors, the <i>oracle</i> returns a message of type <i>cmdErr</i>, and
the sets the field <i>sbDesc</i> to contain a short explanation of the
error.

<p>
</p><ol><p></p><li> Create a UDP socket (see <i>socket(2)</i>).<p></p></li><li> Get the Internet address and port number of the oracle (see
<i>gethostbyname(3)</i> and <i>getservbyname(3)</i>).<p></p></li><li> Open a UDP connection to the <i>oracle</i> (see <i>connect(2)</i>).<p></p></li><li> Send an <i>om</i> message of the appropriate type to the oracle
(see <i>send(2)</i>).<p></p></li><li> Wait for an <i>om</i> reply from the oracle (see <i>recv(2)</i>).
</li></ol><h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000">Basic Objective</a></h1>
<p>
The basic objective of the assignment is to build a client that can obtain
a list of services from the oracle server and connect to a simple service
(one that just returns output such as <em>daytime</em>).  Your server should
be able to register itself with the oracle server and return information
when a client connects to it.
</p><p>
</p><h1><a name="SECTION00050000000000000000">Additional Work</a></h1>
<p>
Completion of the basic objectives is worth 20 of the 30 points for the
assignment.  For the additional points of the project, your client will
need to be able to handle connect to multiple services within a session (in
a serial manner, not in parallel).  Your client should also work well both
with services that require interaction (both input and output) as well as
simple services just producing output.  To obtain additional credit for
your server, it must be interactive in that it both requires input and
produces output.
</p><p>
</p><h1><a name="SECTION00060000000000000000">General Advice</a></h1>
<p>
Nearly all system calls and library routines return some form of error
code if the operation was not successful. <b>You must check the
return value from every routine for an error code</b>.
</p><p>
We suggest the following steps:
</p><ol><p></p><li>  Start small. Write a procedure that sends a datagram to the <i>
oracle</i>, and receives a datagram response from the <i>oracle.</i> If
you made the mistake, the oracle will return an <i>om</i> with <i>
cmd</i> set to <i>cmdErr</i>, and <i>sbDesc</i> will contain a brief
description of the problem.<p></p></li><li> Write a client that connects to a server registered with the
server. We will register a few simple commands (``daytime'' and
``finger'' seem to be staples) that you can use to test your client.<p></p></li><li> Once you have the client working, begin work on the server.
</li></ol>
<p>
You have two weeks in order to complete the project.  There are
three parts to the project you should have each part done in less than
one week to stay on schedule.  In other words your client routine should be
able to obtain a listing of all services no later than November 4th.
</p><p>
As an aid to debugging, as well as to trace use of your server, you
should print trace output when connections are made. For example, you
might print the host name and port number of every user that connects
to your server, along with the time of the connection.
</p><p>
Requests to the oracle are actually a bit more general than we've
described so far. Regular expressions can be used as service names or
users ids to effect a kind of ``wild-search'' for services. For
example, specifying a service name of ``.*'' matches all services.
Specifying a user name of ``...''  matches all services provided by
users with three-character ids. The format of regular expressions is
the same as that of <i>ed(1)</i>.
</p><p>
Use your imagination and creativity in designing server programs. ``Neat''
servers are popular for testing by clients written by your peers.
</p><p>
The following library procedures and system calls will be helpful:
<i>clearerr(3)</i>, <i>gethostname(2)</i>, <i>listen(2)</i>, <i>
close(2)</i>, <i>getpwent(3)</i>, <i>getuid(2)</i>, <i>send(2)</i>, <i>
recv(2)</i>, <i>getservbyname(3),  gethostbyname(3),
gethostbyaddr(3), getsockname(2), bind(2), socket(2), connect(2),
accept(2)</i>, <i>listen(2)</i> and <i>select(2)</i>.
