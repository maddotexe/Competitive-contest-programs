Craig E. Wills
Project 3 (20 pts)<br> 
Assigned: Tuesday, December 8, 1998
Due: Friday, December 18, 1998
<p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00001000000000000000">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This project is intended for you to gain first-hand experience with many
network tools as well as perform traffic monitoring and analysis of
commonly used applications.  These tools use many of the protocols and
concepts we have discussed in class.  The network analysis will help you
better understand the nature of network traffic generated by different
applications.
</p><p>
The project is divided into two parts.  In the first part, you will be
using network tools while in the second part you will be doing traffic
monitoring and analysis.  You are expected to hand in answers to the
questions listed for each part.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00002000000000000000">Network Tools</a></h2>
<p>
The following are the list of network tools that you will be using for this
part of the project.  A summary description for each tool is given.  There
are other tools available, both public domain and products, but we will
concentrate on these tools for the project.
</p><p>
This part of the project can be done on either a CCC Unix machine or a
Windows NT machine in the WINE Lab (Webware, Interfaces and Networking
Experimental Lab, Room A25, Fuller Labs).  The name and complete path name
for each command are given in case the directory is not part of your
command path on the Unix systems.  Commands on Windows NT should be run
from a ``Command Prompt'' window.  To obtain one, select ``Start'' (lower
left corner), then ``Programs'' and then ``Command Prompt'' (near the top).
</p><p>
See the Unix man pages for more details on the description, options and
example usage.  On Windows NT, choose ``Help'' from the menu displayed by
selecting ``Start'' and then enter the utility name to obtain more details.
</p><p>
The tools:
</p><ul><p></p><li> <em>ping</em>, <em>/usr/sbin/ping</em>: This utility 
uses ICMP echo requests to measure the round trip time between two
machines.<p></p></li><li> <em>traceroute</em>, <em>/usr/sbin/traceroute</em>, <em>tracert</em> on
Windows NT: This utility prints the route packets take to a network host.
It also prints timing information.  This utility works by first sending a
packet to the given host with a hopcount of 1.  When the first router
decrements the hopcount and it reaches zero, the router will return an
appropriate ICMP error message to the host.  Next, <em>traceroute</em> sends
with a hop count of 2, then 3 and so on.  It will continue up to a maximum
of 30 hops or until the destination host is reached.  The utility prints
each router and the time to each router.<p></p></li><li> <em>nslookup</em>, <em>/usr/ucb/nslookup</em>:  This utility allows a
Domain Name System server to be queried.  This command has its own shell interface
(use ``exit'' to terminate the command).  Entering a host name causes the
IP address of the name server and the IP address of the host to be
returned.  Entering ``help'' at the prompt gives a list of options.<p></p></li><li> <em>netstat</em>, <em>/usr/sbin/netstat</em>:  This utility prints
various network statistics.  Among the more notable options are:
<dl><dt><strong>-r</strong>
</dt><dd> This option prints out the host's routing tables.  
</dd><dt><strong>-s</strong>
</dt><dd> This option prints displays protocol-specific statistics.
</dd><dt><strong>-H</strong>
</dt><dd> (available only on Unix system).  This option prints out
the current ARP cache for the host.  This information can also be found
using the <em>arp</em> (<em>/usr/sbin/arp</em>) command with the <em>-a</em>
option.
<p>
 </p></dd></dl></li></ul><h3><a name="SECTION00002100000000000000">Network Tools Questions</a></h3>
<p>
The following are specific questions you need to answer for this part of
the project as you test out the various network tools.
</p><ol><p></p><li> Using <em>ping</em>, what is a typical round
trip time between your machine and a CCC machine such as <em>wpi</em> or <em>
garden</em>.  Between a your machine and <em>sequoia</em>?  Between your machine
and one located elsewhere (e.g., <em>lcs.mit.edu, www.berkeley.edu,
www.umass.edu</em>)?  Is there any data loss in any of these tests?  Overall,
are the results what you expect?<p></p></li><li> Use <em>traceroute</em> to trace the route to each of the hosts in the
previous question.  What is the number of hops to each host?  Do hop and
timing results from <em>traceroute</em> correlate and explain your results
from the previous question?<p></p></li><li> What is the IP address of the
machine ``internet'', WPI's gateway to the Internet?<p></p></li><li> What is the Ethernet address of the
machine ``internet'', WPI's gateway to the Internet?  Hint: Try <em>netstat
-H</em> or <em>arp -a</em>.
<p>
</p></li></ol><h2><a name="SECTION00003000000000000000">Network Traffic Analysis</a></h2>
<p>
This part of the project needs to be done on one of the machines in the
WINE Lab.  These machines provide a controlled environment in that each
machine is connected to a switched Ethernet network so that the network
interface for a machine only sees traffic going to and from this machine
(along with spurious broadcast traffic).  In addition, each machine is
``single-user'' so you can better control the applications running that
generate network traffic.
</p><p>
In this part of the project you will be analyzing the type and frequency of
network traffic as you use different applications generated network
traffic. The traffic analyzer you will be using is a Perl script, named
<em>netperf</em>, created for this assignment.  Perl is an interpreted
language with many powerful features.
</p><p>
The expected method to invoke the script is to first create 
a ``Command Prompt'' window.  This window should be created in the folder
corresponding to the desktop window of your PC.  To invoke the script
execute the following command at the prompt:
</p><pre>&gt; \\shiraz\Perl5\perl \\shiraz\cew\netperf</pre>
<p>
where the <em>perl</em> interpreter is located on shiraz as well as the
<em>netperf</em> script.
</p><p>
The script uses the output of <em>netstat -s</em> invoked at 5 second
intervals to monitor changes in all protocol statistics.  At each 5 second
interval, it prints the protocol statistics that have changed during the
interval and the counts for that interval.  The script will run forever and
must be manually terminated using ``Ctrl-c'' (pressing the ``c'' while
holding down ``Ctrl'').  At this point, <em>netperf</em> will create a file
named <tt>netdata.csv</tt>, which is a ``comma-separated-value'' spreadsheet
file readable by Excel.  In fact the icon for this file should show it as
an Excel file.
</p><p>
Clicking on the <tt>netdata.csv</tt> icon (should be located on your desktop
if you executed <em>netperf</em> from this directory) will cause a
spreadsheet of values to pop-up for all protocol statistics that changed
during the lifetime of the script.  You can graph all variables or portions
by selecting ``Insert'', then ``Chart'' and we suggest ``Line''.  Then
select ``Next;<i>SPMgt</i>;'' to get a chart.  Note: It is important that you select
``Series in: Columns'' to get the data plotted with the correct labels.
You may ``Continue'' and put in axis labels or just ``Finish.''  Note:
Rather than graphing all variables, you may want to select a portion of the
columns and graph only those variables.  You may want to print the graph of
your statistics to support your answers.
</p><p>
For this part of the project you will be monitoring the network traffic
generated by various applications.  The easiest way to execute the commands
(other than the Web browser) is run the <em>netperf</em> script in one
window and create another ``Command Prompt'' window for executing
commands.  You may want to stop the <em>netperf</em> script after each
application for easier analysis of that application's traffic patterns.
Note: A new copy of the <tt>netdata.csv</tt> file will be created each time,
overwriting the existing copy.
The applications are:
</p><ul><p></p><li> <em>telnet</em>:  An interactive login to generate interactive traffic
from command-style interface.  Use it to login to your CCC Unix account and
execute some commands to generate interactive network traffic.<p></p></li><li> <em>Netscape</em>: Start up the web browser by double-clicking on the
icon from the desktop.  Retrieve your home page.  Retrieve other pages.<p></p></li><li> <em>ftp</em>:  A file transfer program.  You should login to your CCC
Unix account and transfer a larger file using the <em>get</em> command
within FTP (use <em>quit</em> to exit).
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION00003100000000000000">Network Traffic Analysis Questions</a></h3>
<p>
</p><ol><p></p><li> Which protocol statistics show activity when a telnet session is active?<p></p></li><li> How many TCP connections are opened when you retrieve a page?  
Obtain a page with a given set of images.  View the information about a web
page (using ``Cntl-I'') to see how many embedded images it includes.  Does this number
correspond to any network statistics?<p></p></li><li> Which protocol statistics show activity when an FTP session is
active?  How do these statistics compare to those for telnet?  What is the
data rate for transferred file (from the output of <em>ftp</em>)?<p></p></li><li> A DNS query can use either TCP or UDP.  What protocol does 
<em>nslookup</em> use?<p></p></li><li> What ICMP message types are used with <em>ping</em> and <em>
traceroute</em>?   
</li></ol><h2><a name="SECTION00004000000000000000">Basic Objective</a></h2>
<p>
For the basic objective of the project, worth 18 points, answer the
questions given for each of the project parts.  For the two additional
points, go beyond this set of questions and perform some other test or
answer another question that you decide upon.   This part of the project is
to encourage you to use the tools to obtain results not specifically asked
for in the basic portion of the project.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00005000000000000000">WINE Lab Access</a></h2>
<p>
A WINE account has been created you based on the initial class roster with
your CCC usernames and passwords the same as username (you will be prompted
to change your password on first access).  Your home directory is on shiraz
(<code>\\shiraz\username</code>).  You should not expect to store any files
permanently on the workstations as they are not backed up, and may
occasionally be reimaged.  The room has a card key lock with your student
ID serving as the keycard.  The lock will open for you Monday-Saturday from
07h00 to 23h00.  Any questions or problems should be reported to
system@cs.wpi.edu.
