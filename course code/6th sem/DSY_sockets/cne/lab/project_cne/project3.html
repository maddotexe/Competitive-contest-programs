	<h3> <font color="#8A2908">Project 3</font> </h3>
             <b>DUE DATE: April 29, 2013 (11:59pm) </b> <br>

	<h3> <font color="#8A2908"> Description </font> </h3>
        <p align="justify"> In this assignment you will be asked to 
implement a distributed asynchronous distance vector (DV) routing 
protocol. This project will be completed using C/C++ over a network 
emulator already provided. No knowledge of Unix system calls will be 
needed to complete this project.</p>

	<h3> <font color="#8A2908">Details </font> </h3>
         <p> 
	 </p><ol>
	   <li> Detailed <b>project description</b> can be found <b><a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/%7Ekven/courses/cs3516-d13/Projects/project_3_desc.html">here</a></b> </li>
	   <li> In this programming assignment, you will be writing the sending
 and receiving IP-level messages for routing data over a network </li>
           <li> Your code will have to execute in a emulated 
hardware/software environment. Programming interface provided to your 
routines, i.e., the code that would call your entities from above and 
from below is very close to what is done in an actual UNIX environment. 
Stopping/starting of timers are also simulated, and timer interrupts 
will cause your timer handling routine to be activated </li>
	   <li> This assignment is worth - <b> 100 points </b></li>
	   <li> Make sure you read the "helpful hints" and Q/A section in project description </li>
	</ol>
	<p>

	</p><h3> <font color="#8A2908">Submission </font> </h3> 
	<p> As a part of the submission you need to provide a zip file "your-wpi-login_project3.zip"
	</p><ol>
           <li> <b> All</b> the code and data files for the DV routing 
protocol implementation, including any code that was pre-provided as 
part of this project</li>
	   <li> A ReadMe (txt) file that spells out exactly how to compile and run the code</li>	          
           <li> A PDF document design document with details of your protocol and what to expect in the output trace and what it means</li>
           <li> A PDF document with the output trace as described in the project description</li>
	</ol>
	<p> Submit your document electronically via Instruct Assist 
(http://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/cs3516) by 11:59pm on the day the assignment 
is due. Make sure you choose "Project 3" under project drop-down in IA 
before uploading the zip file. </p>
		
	<h3> <font color="#8A2908">Grading </font> </h3> 
	<p> Grade breakup (%) assuming all documents are present: </p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Functioning DV routing protocol code = 50% </li>
          <li> README document describing how to compile and run your code = 5% </li>
	  <li> Design document routing protocol description  = 25% </li>
	  <li> DV routing protocol output trace  = 20% </li>
	</ol>
	
	<p> The grade will be a ZERO if: 
        </p><ol>
	  <li> If the code does not compile or gives a run-time error </li>
	  <li> If README with detailed instructions on compiling the running the code is not present </li> 
	</ol>
