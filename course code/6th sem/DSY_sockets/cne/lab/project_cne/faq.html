    <h1>15-441 Spring 2005 Project 2 FAQ</h1>

<dl>
<dt>When is the project due?</dt>
<dd>Sunday, April 24, 2005, at midnight EST.</dd>
<p>
<dt>Are time-outs per-packet or per-connection?</dt>
<dd>Per-connection</dd>
<p>
<dt>How do I handle (weird packet loss scenario)</dt>
<dd>All packet losses or timeouts are handled the same way:
<ol>
<li>Set ssthresh = max(cwnd / 2,  2)
<li>set cwnd = 1
<li>Retransmit the lost packet
<li>Ignore all following duplicate ACKs until the connection has
	    started making forward proress.  (Do not count them
            as multiple losses).
</ol>
</dd>

<p>
<dt>My code works stand-alone, but not with the checkpoint script!</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>First, there's a known problem with the checkpoint scripts if you
	  print excess debugging output.  Try disabling the debugging
	  output and see if it works.

<li>Second, see if your code works with the basic <tt>spiffy_*</tt>
	  routines, without the <tt>SPIFFY_ROUTER</tt> environment
	  variable set.  It should work just like normal.

<li>Third, try manually running the peers through netsim.pl.  Make
	      sure that the port #s your program uses for netsim,
	      etc., are configured properly.

<li>Fourth, make sure that your copies of spiffy/netsim/etc., are up
		to date.  There have been several updates to the code.

</ul>
</dd>
<p>

<dt>How can I record my program's output from the checkpoint scripts?</dt>
<dd>

Modify the checkpoint scrip to run your client with ouput redirected
	to <tt>tee</tt>.  <tt>tee</tt> copies output to both its
	  standard output and to the file you specify.  (Remember that
	  the check script still needs the output of your program!)
<p>
<pre>
set c1_pid [spawn /bin/sh -c "$client_binary -f $masterchunks -p $nodes -c $empty -i 1 -m 1 -d $debug | tee first.output"]
</pre>

Another way to accomplish this, but without causing the extra
	debugging output to confuse the check script, is to use the
	debugging macros we provided (which spit debugging output to
	stderr instead of stdout).  You can also redirect just stderr to a
	file:

<pre>
set c1_pid [spawn /bin/sh "$client_binary -f $masterchunks -p $nodes -c $empty -i 1 -m 1 -d $debug 2> first.stderr"]
</pre>

<p>
In both of these cases, we've had to modify the spawn to run a shell
	  which then executes the specified command.  Output
	  redirection of this sort is a shell function, and by
	  default, spawn just executes the requested program directly.


</dd>
<p>
<dt>I'm having a hard time debugging my code.  Help!</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>  Enable core dumps.  In csh:
<pre>

      limit                               see the limits
      unlimit coredumpsize
      limit coredumpsize unlimited        unlimit it

     In bash:    ulimit -c             to see the coredump size limit
                 ulimit -c unlimited   to unlimit it
</pre>

<li>  Run gdb on a core file:<br>
     <tt>gdb &lt;binary&gt; &lt;coredump file&gt;</tt>
<p>

<li>  Attach gdb to a currently running process:
     <tt>gdb &lt;binary&gt; &lt;process ID&gt;</tt>

<p>
     To find the process ID:<br>
     <tt>ps auxww | grep &lt;program name&gt;</tt>
</ul>

<p>

You can't run the checkpoint script
on the netclass machines because the expect binary isn't compiled
for that environment.  However, you can still run your programs
there and tcpdump them, if you don't have a linux / bsd / macos x
machine of your own to run on.  To tcpdump problems with spiffy,
you'll want to supply the -i lo  (linux) or -i lo0  (bsd, mac)
flag to tell tcpdump to sniff on the loopback interface.
